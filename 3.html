        As I researched the topic of worldbuilding, I wanted to create something that was immersive and visually compelling to look at.
        Given my relative lack of experience with 3D modelling, I also knew that it would be best to create something simple; thus, the fractal polygons
        in this project were created. By giving simple shapes slight animations, I sought to create an immersive visual experience for the
        viewer to be able to partake in. Relating to the idea of world building, the polygons depicted above orbit similar to the way moons and asteroids
        orbit planets. In a way, the fractal polgyons act as a world in and of themselves.

        Each of the two segments demonstrate two fractal polygons with rotating satellites around them. One of them is a wireframe and the other is solid.
